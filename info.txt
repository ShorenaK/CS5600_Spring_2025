Tar commednlines:

tar -cvf userid-cs5600-s25-week3.tar genrand.c polybius.c polybius.h cipher.c Makefile

Run:
Create tar:
tar -cvf userid-cs5600-s25-week3.tar genrand.c polybius.c polybius.h cipher.c Makefile
Verify contents:

Run:
tar -tvf userid-cs5600-s25-week3.tar
Extract tar:

Run:
tar -xvf userid-cs5600-s25-week3.tar
Test after extraction:

Run:
make
./cipher -e "test message"
./genrand 10 output.txt



Tar :


Step 2: Update the Existing .tar Archive
After modifying cipher.c, update the tar archive without recreating it:

tar -rvf userid-cs5600-s25-week3.tar cipher.c
Explanation of options:

-r: Append or replace the updated file inside the tar archive.
-v: Verbose mode (shows progress).
-f: Specifies the archive filename.
Step 3: Verify the Update
Once you've updated the archive, check its contents to ensure cipher.c is included:


tar -tvf userid-cs5600-s25-week3.tar
You should see the updated timestamp next to cipher.c.

Step 4: Test the Updated Archive
To ensure your updates are correct, you can extract the files and verify the changes:

tar -xvf userid-cs5600-s25-week3.tar
cat cipher.c
This will display the contents of cipher.c to confirm your comments were added successfully.

REMOVE The Tar:
rm anzhilov.s-cs5600-s25-week3.tar


if you want to confirm which files are executables before deleting:
ls -l | grep '^-rwx'  # Lists only executable files


Verify the Contents of the .tar File
Use the following command to list the contents of the archive and check that no executable files (such as cipher, genrand, etc.) are included:

tar -tvf anzhilov.s-cs5600-s25-week3.tar

-rw-r--r--  0 shorenaanzhilov staff     264 Jan 21 14:23 Makefile
-rw-r--r--  0 shorenaanzhilov staff     950 Jan 21 14:47 cipher.c
-rw-r--r--  0 shorenaanzhilov staff    1511 Jan 21 13:41 genrand.c

-rw-r--r--  0 shorenaanzhilov staff     417 Jan 21 14:28 polybius.h


How to Use the Updated Makefile
Compile both programs:


make all

Compile a specific program:


make cipher
make genrand

Clean up the compiled files:


make clean



Testing Your Setup -----> 
Once the Makefile is updated, test by:

Running the build:


Checking the created executables:


ls -l cipher genrand
Running the programs:


./cipher -e "test"
./genrand 10 output.txt



ls
Expected files:


Makefile
cipher.c
genrand.c
polybius.c
polybius.h


Run make to compile and test:


make
./cipher -e "test"
./genrand 10 output.txt
Clean up executables before submission:


make clean
Create the tar archive for submission:


tar -cvf userid-cs5600-s25-week3.tar Makefile cipher.c genrand.c polybius.c polybius.h
Verify the tar archive:


tar -tvf userid-cs5600-s25-week3.tar
