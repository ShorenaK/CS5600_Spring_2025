Tar commednlines:

tar -cvf userid-cs5600-s25-week3.tar genrand.c polybius.c polybius.h cipher.c Makefile

Run:
Create tar:
tar -cvf userid-cs5600-s25-week3.tar genrand.c polybius.c polybius.h cipher.c Makefile
Verify contents:

Run:
tar -tvf userid-cs5600-s25-week3.tar
Extract tar:

Run:
tar -xvf userid-cs5600-s25-week3.tar
Test after extraction:

Run:
make
./cipher -e "test message"
./genrand 10 output.txt

Step 2: Update the Existing .tar Archive
After modifying cipher.c, update the tar archive without recreating it:

tar -rvf userid-cs5600-s25-week3.tar cipher.c
Explanation of options:

-r: Append or replace the updated file inside the tar archive.
-v: Verbose mode (shows progress).
-f: Specifies the archive filename.
Step 3: Verify the Update
Once you've updated the archive, check its contents to ensure cipher.c is included:


tar -tvf userid-cs5600-s25-week3.tar
You should see the updated timestamp next to cipher.c.

Step 4: Test the Updated Archive
To ensure your updates are correct, you can extract the files and verify the changes:

tar -xvf userid-cs5600-s25-week3.tar
cat cipher.c
This will display the contents of cipher.c to confirm your comments were added successfully.
