In 3rd  part of the assignment, I modified the producer consumer problem to use monitors with condition variables. 
The buffer size was increased to 15, and multiple producer and consumer threads were added to handle concurrency.

### Follwing Changes were Made:
1. Increased buffer size to 15.
2. Added two producer threads and two consumer threads.
3. Used mutex and condition variables to synchronize the threads.
4. Implemented counters to track the total produced and consumed items.
5. Exited producer threads after producing 30 items.
6. Exited consumer threads after consuming 30 items.
7. Added print statements to monitor buffer usage over time.

### Observations are following:
- The producers wait when the buffer is full, and consumers wait when it is empty.
- Synchronization works well with condition variables to ensure data consistency.
- Thread scheduling by the operating system introduces non-deterministic behavior in the output order.

### In Summery:
This implementation demonstrates how monitors help in controlling thread execution 
using condition variables and mutexes to avoid data corruption and race conditions.
